# Captioning Services

The core captioning logic is in [service.py](mdc:src/i2t/service.py):

- `BaseCaptionService`: Abstract base class for captioning services.
- `BlipCaptionService`: Uses the BLIP base model for image captioning.
- `BlipLargeCaptionService`: Uses the BLIP-Large model for more accurate captions.

Each service can be used via the CLI or as a Python module. Only BLIP and BLIP-Large are supported.
